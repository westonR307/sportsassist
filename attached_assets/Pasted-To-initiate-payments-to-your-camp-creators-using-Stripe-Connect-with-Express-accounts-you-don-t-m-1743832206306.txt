To initiate payments to your camp creators using Stripe Connect (with Express accounts), you don’t manually trigger a payout — Stripe handles it automatically after a successful payment, based on how you structure the charge.

Here’s how it works with Destination Charges (which you’re using):

How Payments to Camp Creators Work

1. You Create the Payment

When an athlete pays for a camp:

const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'payment',
  payment_method_types: ['card'],
  line_items: [{
    price_data: {
      currency: 'usd',
      unit_amount: 11500, // $115 if fee passed to athlete
      product_data: {
        name: 'Baseball Camp',
      },
    },
    quantity: 1,
  }],
  payment_intent_data: {
    application_fee_amount: 1500, // $15 platform fee
    transfer_data: {
      destination: 'acct_1ABCXYZ...', // Creator's Stripe Connect ID
    },
  },
  success_url: 'https://sportsassist.io/success',
  cancel_url: 'https://sportsassist.io/cancel',
});

	•	Stripe automatically splits the payment:
	•	Sends your platform fee to you
	•	Sends the rest to the creator’s connected account
	•	Stripe then schedules a payout to the camp creator based on their payout schedule (default is daily/automatic, but creators can customize it in their Express dashboard)

2. No Manual Action Needed

You do not have to:
	•	Call a “pay creator” API
	•	Trigger a transfer manually
	•	Handle tax or payout timing

Stripe handles it automatically because you passed transfer_data.destination in the payment creation.

3. Where You Might “Initiate” a Payment

If you were using Separate Charges and Transfers, you’d:
	•	First collect the entire payment to your platform
	•	Then use stripe.transfers.create() to manually send funds to the creator

But since you’re using Destination Charges, you don’t need this. Stripe handles the transfer behind the scenes.

How to Track Payments/Payouts

You can:
	•	Use Stripe webhooks like payment_intent.succeeded to track when payments complete
	•	Use account.payout.created and account.payout.paid events if you want to show creators payout info
	•	Display earnings in your dashboard by storing transaction metadata per creator

⸻

TL;DR
	•	You initiate a Checkout Session with application_fee_amount and transfer_data.destination
	•	Stripe splits the payment and pays the creator automatically
	•	No manual payout needed
