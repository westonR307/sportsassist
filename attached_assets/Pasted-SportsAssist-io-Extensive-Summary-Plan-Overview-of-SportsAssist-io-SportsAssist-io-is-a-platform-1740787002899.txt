SportsAssist.io – Extensive Summary & Plan
Overview of SportsAssist.io
SportsAssist.io is a platform designed to streamline the creation, management, and registration process for sports camps. It provides a centralized solution for both organizations and individual coaches to host sports programs while making it easy for parents and participants to register, pay, and communicate.

Public & private camp listings
Parent-guardian relationships for managing multiple children
Role-based permissions for different organization members
Participant & program management tools
Payment handling and automated notifications

Target Users & Role Breakdown
The platform has two main user categories:
Participants & Parents – Individuals who register for camps.
Organizations – Those who run and manage camps.
Each category has multiple role types with specific permissions.
