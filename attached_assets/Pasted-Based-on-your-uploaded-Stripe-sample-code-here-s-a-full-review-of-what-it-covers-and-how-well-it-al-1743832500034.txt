Based on your uploaded Stripe sample code, here’s a full review of what it covers and how well it aligns with the goals we’ve discussed for SportsAssist.io:

⸻

1. Express Account Onboarding – ✅ Working

Files involved: server.rb, useStripeConnect.js
	•	POST /account creates an Express connected account via the Stripe API.
	•	The account includes:
	•	capabilities for card_payments and transfers (required)
	•	controller.fees.payer: "application" – this is correct for using application_fee_amount
	•	controller.stripe_dashboard.type: "none" – this disables the dashboard (more on this below)
	•	POST /account_session creates an onboarding session using the embedded method via Stripe Connect JS.

Frontend hook (useStripeConnect.js) properly:
	•	Sends connectedAccountId to the server
	•	Fetches a client_secret for the onboarding session
	•	Loads and initializes Stripe Connect’s embedded UI with your branding

Note: You’re disabling the Express dashboard via "stripe_dashboard": { type: "none" }. If you want to let creators access the Stripe Express dashboard (recommended), change this to "type": "express".

⸻

2. Destination Charges – ❌ Not Yet Implemented

There is no route yet to create a payment (Checkout Session or PaymentIntent) using application_fee_amount and transfer_data.destination.

You’ll need to implement a new route for this (e.g., /create-checkout-session or /charge) and include:

payment_intent_data: {
  application_fee_amount: <your platform fee>,
  transfer_data: {
    destination: <connected_account_id>
  }
}

This is essential for:
	•	Automatically sending payouts to camp creators
	•	Letting Stripe handle fee splitting
	•	Ensuring you receive your platform fee

⸻

3. Webhook Handling – ❌ Not Yet Implemented

There are no webhook routes or logic in the sample. You’ll want to add a route like /webhook and listen for:
	•	checkout.session.completed — to track successful camp registrations
	•	payment_intent.succeeded — to log finalized payments
	•	Optionally account.updated, payout.paid, etc. for creator onboarding/payout tracking

⸻

4. Payouts – ✅ Handled by Stripe

Once you send payments using transfer_data.destination, Stripe automatically handles payouts based on the creator’s payout schedule (usually daily by default). You don’t have to manually send payouts.

Just make sure you’re using destination charges, or the funds won’t reach the connected account.

⸻

5. Taxes & 1099s – ✅ Stripe Handles

Your setup (Express + destination charges) ensures:
	•	Creators are classified as sellers
	•	Stripe handles identity verification, tax info, and 1099-K issuance
	•	You do not need to file 1099s, as long as you don’t pay creators outside Stripe

You will need to track your own application fees for your business income.

⸻

✅ What’s Good
	•	Express onboarding with embedded Connect components is implemented well
	•	Clean separation between frontend and backend
	•	Stripe Connect setup includes proper capabilities and fee responsibility settings

⸻

❌ What’s Missing / Needs Added
	1.	Create payment route using application_fee_amount and transfer_data.destination
	2.	Webhook route to log payments and track activity
	3.	(Optional but recommended): Change stripe_dashboard.type from "none" to "express" to allow creators to access their payout dashboard
	4.	(Optional): Stripe Tax configuration for automatic sales tax collection
